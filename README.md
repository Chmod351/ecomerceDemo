# Open Source Project Contribution Guide

Welcome to the open-source contribution guide for the Ecommerce frontend project! This project is developed using React, Redux, and Styled-Components. It consumes the [Api](https://github.com/yamilt351/api-rest). 
for data retrieval. To better understand the API and its endpoints, we recommend carefully reading the [Project Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21643141/2s93sXcaLf#f3eb5112-676b-46c6-89a2-f5dd6b6c0927) . Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback.

- The tasks in the backlog are the ones that can be developed, but they may not necessarily be developed
- To-Do Tasks are tasks that we must do.
- The assigned tasks will be marked as Doing.
- Once a pull request is done, the task will be moved to "Review", where its approval or rejection will be awaited. In case of rejection, the task will be marked as "To-Do" again, and another pull request should be done with the new changes.
